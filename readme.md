### Helen Portfolio

My portfolio is built using **HTML**, **CSS** (SASS/SCSS) and **Javascript**.  The code follows the <a href="http://getbem.com/">Block Element Modifier (BEM)</a> naming methodology, and the components are developed using Brad Frost's <a href="https://bradfrost.com/blog/post/atomic-web-design/">atomic design principles</a>.
