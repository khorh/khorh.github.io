            <p>
              Brainstormed with the client words that resonates with her
              business. At the end of the session, the client settled with
              ‘modern’ and ‘smart’ which ultimately underpins this project.

            <h5>1.2 Typography</h5>
            <p>
              Recommended ‘Montserrat’ for the typography as its widely used and
              modern; the client agreed.

            <h5>1.3 Color</h5>
            <p>
              The client already had something in mind for the colour palette –
              burgundy as the primary and slate grey for the secondary colour.

            <h5>1.4 Business name and strapline</h5>
            <p>
              The business name is simply 'Astra' and for the strapline, the
              client wanted to include all three aspects of her business. As the
              strapline is not as prominent as the business name, the secondary
              colour was used.

          <div class="card-item">
            <h5>1.5 Icon</h5>
            <p>
              Astra in Latin means ‘star’ which provided inspiration for the
              logo design. Google images was used to research into different
              star designs and ensure the design avoided negative or religious
              connotations e.g., Star of David. The main component of the design
              is the ‘star’ icon and through sketching, 12 different icons were
              created. The client finally decided on a simple and clean block
              design for the star icon.

            <p>
              The process of idea generation to vectorising was used when
              designing the business card. Sizing and language requirements were
              taken into consideration since the client is based in Qatar.

              The standard letter format was used since the client is in the
              professional domain. Different designs were presented to the
              client and the final version is illustrated below.

              The client already used a pre-made template from Powerpoint for
              her existing business. Therefore, this template was manipulated to
              adhere to the new branding.
